# Bio
I’m a simple but tremendously curious person. I decided to blah blah blah. I really enjoy discovering, knowing and understanding about the only universe I’ll ever life on. I’ve developed a great love for lalala.  Nowadays I’m focusing on the emergent field of Machine Learning.

Also, I went to Australia and worked as a deckhand for almost two years, which I am pretty proud of.
