I’m a simple but tremendously curious person. I decided to blah blah blah. I really enjoy discovering, knowing and understanding about the only universe I’ll ever life on. I’ve developed a great love for lalala. I even ended up doing a Master degree towards understanding Metal-Insulator transitions. Nowadays I’m focusing on the emergent field of Machine Learning.
