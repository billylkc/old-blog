## Introduction

When you are working in a team, you may want to have a stable environment, so everyone can easily access your analysis findings, and reproduce the result.
Windows may be good for our day to day work, but when it comes to stability and reproducibility, it may not be working as well as their Linux counterparts.

If you are having troubles in setting up a Data Science working environment or installing packages/dependencies, or maintaining your analysis project, read on. Give yourself a try with a Linux server, and set it up for free (For a year, at least ã‹¡) on AWS.


## Create a virtual machine on AWS

Setting up a virtual machine on Cloud environment is easier than ever. Most cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure) are providing free credits for new users. Today we are going to setup an Amazone **EC2 Ubuntu machine** on AWS using a free-tier account.

_Key steps_
* Go to Amazon Web Service - [here](https://aws.amazon.com/free)
* Assume you have already signed up for an AWS account
* Login to your account by clicking _Sign in to the Console_ at the top right corner
* Go to All services > Compute > E2
* Launch an _Ubuntu (x86) Instance_
* Choose the _t2 micro instance_ (1 vCPU, 1 GB Ram, 8Gb Storage)
* Launch Instance with default settings
* Create a new key pairs (**Important!** -  _Download Key Pairs_ for later use)
* Wait the Instance to be Initiated (Can take a few minutes)
* TA-TA
