## Introduction

When you are working in a team, you may want to have a stable environment, so everyone can easily access your analysis findings, and reproduce the result.

I have learned throughout the years, Windows may be good for our day to day work, but when it comes to stability and reproducibility, it may not be working as well as their GNU/Linux counterparts.

If you are having troubles in setting up a Data Science environment or installing packages/dependencies, or even maintaining your analysis project, read on. Give yourself a try with a Linux server, and set it up for free (At least for a year ã‹¡) on AWS.

Setting up a virtual machine on Cloud environment is easier than ever.
