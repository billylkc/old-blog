## Introduction

When you are working in a team, you may want to have a stable environment, so everyone can easily access your analysis findings, and reproduce the result.

If you are having troubles in setting up a Data Science working environment or installing packages/dependencies, or maintaining your analysis project, read on. Give yourself a try with a Linux server, and set it up for free (For a year, at least ã‹¡) on AWS.


## Create a virtual machine on AWS
