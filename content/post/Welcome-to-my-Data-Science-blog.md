Welcome to my official Data Science Blog!

If you checked out the "About Me" page then you know my name is Billy. And this is my first blog where I will be posting about how to be more effective as a Data Sceientist.

I will start with some basics stuff, like day-to-day tools that I use, some visualizations and Python/R code snippets.

And maybe some algorithms that I use at work. Stay tuned.

If you like my blog, feel free to message me and suggest. I am always open to learn new stuff and make friends.
